# Windows Honeypot in Azure with Microsoft Sentinel Attack Map
This project sets up a Windows 10 honeypot in Microsoft Azure, connects it to Microsoft Sentinel, enriches attacker IPs with geolocation data, and visualizes global attacks using an interactive dashboard.

🚀 Project Overview
- Deploy a Windows 10 VM as a honeypot in Azure.
- Collect system and network logs using Sysmon.
- Send logs to Microsoft Sentinel via a Log Analytics Workspace.
- Enrich external IP addresses with geolocation data using Watchlists.
- Build an interactive global attack map inside Sentinel.

🛠️ Setup Guide
1. Create and Configure the Azure VM
_ Deploy a Windows 10 virtual machine.
- Harden it lightly to make it look real but vulnerable (optional: weak passwords, open RDP).
- Install and configure Sysmon for detailed event logging.
  
Detailed steps: setup/azure_vm_setup.md

2. Set Up Sysmon
- Use a customized sysmon_config.xml to monitor process creation, network connections, and more.
  
Configuration: setup/sysmon_config.xml

3. Connect VM Logs to Microsoft Sentinel
- Set up a Log Analytics Workspace.
- Connect Windows event logs and Sysmon logs to Sentinel.
- Create a Sysmon Connector if needed.

Instructions: setup/sentinel_connector_setup.md

📊 Visualizing Attacks
Enrichment and Queries
- Upload a Watchlist mapping IPs to country/geolocation info: queries/geolocation_watchlist.csv
- Use custom KQL queries to pull attacker IPs and visualize them: queries/ip_geolocation_query.kql
